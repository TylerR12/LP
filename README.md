# LED_Project

This is a project I built that can be controlled easily through different devices such as phones, computers and tablets. The Lights are powered by a Raspberry Pi which also set the color of the light based on what is chosen by the user. The website that lets the user choose the color of the lights is also requires a username and password so that not just anyone can access the lights anytime. This project is possible because of firebase which is a real-time database that stores the current color of the lights.
