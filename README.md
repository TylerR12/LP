# LED_Project

This is a project I built that can be controlled easily through different devices such as phones, computers and tablets. The Lights are powered by a Raspberry Pi which also set the color of the light based on what is chosen by the user. The website that lets the user choose the color of the lights is also has a login page to that allows user to create a account or use previous accounts. This project is possible because of firebase which is a real-time database that stores the current color of the lights.
